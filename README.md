# basic-braining-next-js
I wrote one lesson in a "teach yourself to code" guide. Let's see if I can complete it using React and NextJS.

## Skip the background, show me the result!
Sure thing: [here it is](https://benseymourodb.github.io/basic-braining-next-js/src/index.html).

## The Background
A couple of years ago, an acquaintance reached out with a request that went something like this:

> I'm tired of my food-service job, and programming seems neat and lucrative. I've done some online tutorials for HTML and JavaScript, but I feel like what I need now is someone to tutor me on improving my skills. Can you help me?

Against my better judgement, I said "sure." I got excited about the possibility of creating a task-driven course for learning and applying more of what the guy had expressed interest in. I could write the first lesson, and tailor additional ones to things that he wanted to work on. If it worked well, maybe I could offer the materials I created to other people, too.

I wrote the first lesson. I never heard from him again.

Now I find that I have a need to learn NextJS for ODBM's new internal-apps tech stack, but I'm having trouble focusing on the tutorials I've found. I know that I work best when I have a problem to solve... So I'm going to try to solve the problem I posed to my absentee mentee.

## The Task
Taken from my Notion page at [Witfire Tutoring - I Know HTML, Now What? 1: Basic Braining](https://witfire-tutoring.notion.site/1-Basic-Braining-75573b822e5f442b8d5577aceac982ee).
